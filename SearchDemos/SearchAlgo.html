  <div class="col details">
    <h3>Instant Find</h3>
    <p>Finds the path instantly. You can toggle nodes visited on and off</p>

    <h3>Dynamic Find</h3>
    <p>Highlights each node it visits in real time. Will automatically trigger "Visited Nodes" so you can see it. You
      can still toggle the visited box to hide the nodes visited if you want. Goes a little slower but really cool to
      watch!
